This project utilizes the C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for prognostics provided by NASA.

The dataset contains simulated time-series data from turbofan engines operating under various conditions until failure. It is designed for developing and validating prognostics and health management algorithms, particularly for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

Specifically, this project uses the FD001 subset, which represents a single operating condition and one fault mode.
